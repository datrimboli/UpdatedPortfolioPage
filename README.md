# UpdatedPortfolioPage

This is my updated portfolio 

The about me gives a brief description about me, and lets the viewer know what they can find on the site.

The portfolio page now contains images, breif descriptions, and links to the assignments and the first project that we have done in the first month of class so far. 

Those assignments are:
1. Password Generator
2. Code Quiz
3. Work Day Scheduler
4. Weather App
5. Pokemon Project 1 

Hope you enjoy the updated portfolio!
