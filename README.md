# UpdatedPortfolioPage

This is my updated portfolio 

The about me gives a brief description about me, and lets the viewer know what they can find on the site.

The portfolio page now contains images, breif descriptions, and links to the assignments and the first two projects that we have done in the first two months of class so far. 

Those assignments are:
1. Burger App
2. Code Quiz
3. Work Day Scheduler
4. Weather App
5. Pokemon Project 1 
6. Busks In Town Project 2

Hope you enjoy the updated portfolio!
